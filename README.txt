These are mods I don't plan on updating any time soon. I may change my mind at some point, but for now they are abandoned.

There are a couple of mods that I would like to update at some point (like Chunk-in-a-Jar), so those aren't here.

Since I don't have the SpaceCore 1.6.4 source uploaded anywhere, pretty much none of these will work in their current state.
